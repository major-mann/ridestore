# Ridestore Assessment

## Changes

1. The server row runs on port 3001 (This is due to the fact that port 5000 is in use on osx and port 6000 (As discussed with Ludvig is a protected port in chrome))
1. There is a `test:jest` as well as a `test` command

## Progress

### Completed

1. ~Make the provided E2E tests pass.~
1. ~Keep server data in memory.~
1. ~Implement client-side validation of the form data.~
1. ~Unit test one module of choice. There is no need to test the whole app, as we only want to understand what you take into consideration when writing unit tests.~
1. ~Avoid duplication and extract re-usable modules where it makes sense. We want to see your approach to creating a codebase that is easy to maintain.~
1. ~Push your code to the new implementation branch. We encourage you to commit and push your changes regularly as it's a good way for you to showcase your thinking process.~

### Unsure of the requirement
1. Ensure that the frontend app remains responsive while the data is being loaded from the server.

### Will complete once this is pushed
1. Create a new pull request, but please do not merge it.
1. Document the tech decisions you've made by creating a new review on your PR (see how). In particular, describe how you've made the frontend responsive.
1. Await further instructions from the hiring team.
